Improved error handling and explicit type checking can prevent these errors.

Example:
```vbscript
On Error Resume Next
Dim obj As Object
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Object.That.Might.NotExist")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Object not found: " & Err.Description
  Err.Clear
End If
' ... Code that uses obj only if it was successfully created ...
On Error GoTo 0
```
This improved example uses `On Error Resume Next` to handle potential errors gracefully. We check for errors after creating the object and display an informative message to the user. 

For type mismatches, use explicit type conversion:
```vbscript
Dim str As String
Dim num As Integer
str = "123"
num = CInt(str) + 4
```
Here, `CInt` explicitly converts the string "123" to an integer before adding it to the integer variable `num`, preventing a type mismatch.
